# Abstract Factory Pattern Implementation Guide

## 1. Overview

### What is Abstract Factory?
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

### Current Implementation
Our implementation demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern using a door manufacturing example:
```java
DoorFactory woodenDoorFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();
Door woodenDoor = woodenDoorFactory.makeDoor();
DoorFittingExpert carpenter = woodenDoorFactory.makeFittingExpert();
```

### Components
1. **Abstract Factory (DoorFactory)**
   - Declares interface for creating door products
   - Methods: makeDoor(), makeFittingExpert()

2. **Concrete Factories**
   - WoodenDoorFactory
   - IronDoorFactory
   - Each creates a family of related products

3. **Abstract Products**
   - Door interface
   - DoorFittingExpert interface

4. **Concrete Products**
   - WoodenDoor, IronDoor
   - Carpenter, Welder

### Why Abstract Factory?
1. **Family of Related Objects**
   - Ensures door and expert compatibility
   - Enforces product family constraints
   
2. **Strong Encapsulation**
   - Concrete classes isolated from client
   - Implementation details hidden

3. **Easy Product Family Swapping**
   - Switch entire product families easily
   - Maintain product consistency

## 2. Design Pattern Decision Framework

### When to Use Abstract Factory?

✅ **Use When:**
- Creating families of related objects
- Products must work together
- System should be independent of product creation
- Product families might be exchanged
- Strong consistency between products needed

❌ **Don't Use When:**
- Only creating single objects
- No product families exist
- Product variations are minimal
- Products don't need to work together

### Decision Tree
```
Do you need to create families of related objects?
├── Yes → Do products need to work together?
│   ├── Yes → Do you need multiple variations?
│   │   ├── Yes → Use Abstract Factory ✅
│   │   └── No → Use Factory Method
│   └── No → Consider Builder/Factory Method
└── No → Use Simple Factory/Factory Method
```

## 3. SOLID Principles Application

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
✅ Each factory is responsible for creating one family of products
✅ Each product class has a single purpose (door or expert)

### 2. Open/Closed Principle
✅ New product families can be added without modifying existing code
✅ Adding new door types doesn't require changing client code

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
✅ All concrete doors can substitute Door interface
✅ All experts can substitute DoorFittingExpert interface

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle
✅ Factory interfaces are focused and minimal
✅ Products have specific, well-defined interfaces

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle
✅ High-level modules depend on abstractions
✅ Client code works with interfaces, not concrete classes

## 4. Implementation Tips

### 1. Factory Method Naming
```java
// Good
makeDoor()
makeFittingExpert()

// Avoid
createDoor() // Less intuitive for factory methods
getDoor() // Implies retrieval rather than creation
```

### 2. Factory Organization
```java
// Good - Grouped by product family
public class WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    @Override
    public Door makeDoor() { return new WoodenDoor(); }
    @Override
    public DoorFittingExpert makeFittingExpert() { return new Carpenter(); }
}

// Avoid - Mixed responsibilities
public class DoorFactory {
    public static Door makeWoodenDoor() { ... }
    public static Door makeIronDoor() { ... }
}
```

### 3. Error Handling
```java
public Door makeDoor() {
    try {
        return new WoodenDoor();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new ProductCreationException("Failed to create door", e);
    }
}
```

## 5. Interview Questions

### Q1: What's the difference between Abstract Factory and Factory Method?
**Answer**: 
- Abstract Factory creates families of related objects
- Factory Method creates a single type of object
- Abstract Factory often uses multiple Factory Methods
- Abstract Factory enforces relationships between products

### Q2: How would you extend this implementation to support a new door type?
**Answer**:
1. Create new concrete products:
   ```java
   public class GlassDoor implements Door { ... }
   public class GlassExpert implements DoorFittingExpert { ... }
   ```
2. Create new factory:
   ```java
   public class GlassDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
       @Override
       public Door makeDoor() { return new GlassDoor(); }
       @Override
       public DoorFittingExpert makeFittingExpert() { 
           return new GlassExpert(); 
       }
   }
   ```

### Q3: How does Abstract Factory help with dependency management?
**Answer**:
- Centralizes product creation logic
- Reduces direct dependencies on concrete classes
- Makes product families easily swappable
- Ensures product compatibility within families

### Q4: What are the trade-offs of using Abstract Factory?
**Answer**:
- ➕ Ensures product compatibility
- ➕ Isolates concrete classes
- ➕ Easy to exchange product families
- ➖ Can be complex for simple cases
- ➖ Many interfaces and classes needed
- ➖ All products in family must be defined

### Q5: How would you implement lazy initialization in Abstract Factory?
**Answer**:
```java
public class WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    private Door door;
    private DoorFittingExpert expert;

    @Override
    public Door makeDoor() {
        if (door == null) {
            door = new WoodenDoor();
        }
        return door;
    }
}
```

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Over-complexity
❌ **Don't:**
```java
// Too many product variations
public interface DoorFactory {
    Door makeDoor();
    DoorFrame makeFrame();
    DoorHandle makeHandle();
    DoorHinge makeHinge();
    DoorLock makeLock();
    // Too many products
}
```

✅ **Do:**
```java
public interface DoorFactory {
    Door makeDoor();
    DoorFittingExpert makeFittingExpert();
}
```

### 2. Tight Coupling
❌ **Don't:**
```java
public class Client {
    private WoodenDoorFactory factory; // Concrete class
}
```

✅ **Do:**
```java
public class Client {
    private DoorFactory factory; // Interface
}
```

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```java
@Test
void shouldCreateCompatibleProducts() {
    DoorFactory factory = new WoodenDoorFactory();
    Door door = factory.makeDoor();
    DoorFittingExpert expert = factory.makeFittingExpert();
    
    assertTrue(door instanceof WoodenDoor);
    assertTrue(expert instanceof Carpenter);
}

@Test
void shouldAllowProductFamilySwap() {
    DoorFactory factory1 = new WoodenDoorFactory();
    DoorFactory factory2 = new IronDoorFactory();
    
    // Should work with both factories
    createDoorSystem(factory1);
    createDoorSystem(factory2);
}
```

Remember: Abstract Factory is about creating families of related objects while maintaining their compatibility. Focus on the relationships between products and ensure each factory creates a complete and consistent set of products.
